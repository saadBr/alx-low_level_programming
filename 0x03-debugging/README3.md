0x03.C - Debugging
----------------------------------------------
0-main.c : test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
1-main.c :  Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2-largest_number.c : correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3-print_remaining_days.c : Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
